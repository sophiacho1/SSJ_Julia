### Sequence State Jacobian (SSJ) Solution Method in Julia
---
We follow [NBER's heterogeneous-agent macro workshop](https://github.com/shade-econ/nber-workshop-2023) to implement the Sequence Space Jacobian (SSJ) solution method in Julia, specifically to solve the one-asset HANK model.

Within the **one asset hank** folder, there are two folders--**fiscal policy** and **monetary policy**--which contain the files needed to solve the one-asset HANK model with fiscal and monetary policy, respectively.

Each of the **fiscal policy** and **monetary policy** folders contain the following files:
- **block.jl**
- **graph.jl**
- **hank.jl**
- **het.jl**
- **sim_steady_state.jl**
- **tutorial.ipynb**
